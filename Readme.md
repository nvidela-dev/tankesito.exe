# Tankesito.exe

A 3D physics-based puzzle game where you launch a chubby kid with a Spiderman backpack as a projectile to solve puzzles.

## Concept

Think Angry Birds meets Golf with Friends - fling your character across levels, bouncing off surfaces with ball-like physics to reach the goal. The game is about mastering trajectory, momentum, and using the environment to complete each puzzle.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** - 3D rendering
- **Rapier** - WASM physics engine
- **Vite** - Build tool

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Project setup
- [ ] Basic 3D scene (camera, lighting, ground)
- [ ] Character model (placeholder)
- [ ] Physics integration
- [ ] Launch mechanics (aim and fire)
- [ ] Level design system
- [ ] Win conditions
